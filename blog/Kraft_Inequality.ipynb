Prefix codes have nice properties and are widely used in applications such as JPEG encoding for images and MP3 for music. A prefix code is such that no codeword is a prefix of any other codewords. For instance, suppose we'd like to encode the letters $\\{a, b, c, d\\}$ in binaries, i.e. using $\\{0, 1\\}$. Then one possible coding scheme is as follows:"

In other words, the codeword $\\sigma_j$ must not contain any of the previous codewords $(\\sigma_1, \\sigma_2, \\dots \\sigma_{j-1})$ as a prefix. For $\\sigma_j$, there are $s^{n_j}$ combination of codewords we could choose from if there was no prefix constraints. But due to the codeword at a prior step $k < j$, $s^{n_j - n_k}$ codewords are now forbidden because they contain $\\sigma_k$ as a prefix. Furthermore, the sets of forbidden codewords due to different prior steps are exclusive. Since if any two prior steps forbid the same codeword at step $j$, that would imply the smaller of the codewords in the two prior steps is a prefix of the other one, which contradicts the prefix assumption.\n",
